# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues

### MixinBooter
Since Version 1.22.0 Embers Unofficial Extended Life uses Mixins to fix issues with other mods. If you are missing [MixinBooter](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixin-booter), you are likely to encounter imcompatibilities with other mods. To fix this, make sure you have [MixinBooter](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixin-booter) installed.
If you are playing a modpack with Embers UEL, make sure the modpack includes MixinBooter. I know that there are a alternatives to MixinBooter, but I don't recommend using them as they are neither used nor tested by me.

### Sledgehammer
[Sledgehammer](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sledgehammer) is a mod that fixes various bugs in a lot of mods. The original Embers is one of them as it hasn't been updated in a long time. Embers Unofficial Extended Life has fixed all Ember-related bugs.
If you are using Sledgehammer, make sure to disable the Embers fixes in the Sledgehammer config.

## Compatibility with another mod
If you are experiencing issues with another mod, please check the [compatibility section](README.md#Compatibility) of the README.md. If the mod is not listed there, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/Ender-Development/Embers-Extended-Life/issues) and I will look into it.
